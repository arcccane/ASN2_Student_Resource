A human resource (HR) department of ABC Pte Ltd has been processing their new employee onboarding
manually for the past 10 years. The following are their manual tasks for a new employee onboarding.

1. Send a list of new employees to corporate admin department for assigning a phone line
2. Send a list of new employees to procurement department for issuing name card and name stamp
3. Send a list of new employees to IT department for issuing a PC and creating an email account

They decided to do away with those manual works of preparing a different list of new employees for the
respective departments to process and have approached me to develop a simple C# console application
to generate txt (i.e. text) files that store the required list of employees for each department in their
shared drive.
