# Employee-Processing-Program

Section A

A human resource (HR) department of ABC Pte Ltd has been processing their new employee onboarding
manually for the past 10 years. The following are their manual tasks for a new employee onboarding.

1. Send a list of new employees to corporate admin department for assigning a phone line
2. Send a list of new employees to procurement department for issuing name card and name stamp
3. Send a list of new employees to IT department for issuing a PC and creating an email account

They decided to do away with those manual works of preparing a different list of new employees for the
respective departments to process and have approached me to develop a simple C# console application
to generate txt (i.e. text) files that store the required list of employees for each department in their
shared drive.

Section B

Implemented a simple payroll calculator to help them prepare monthly payroll for the company. The payroll 
calculator takes in hire type and salary of the employee for payroll calculation. These hire type has the 
following values:

1. Full-time = salary (assuming full time works 40 hours per week)

2. Part-time = 0.5 * salary (assuming part-timer works 20 hours per week)

3. Hourly = 0.25 * salary (assuming the employee works 10 hours per week)
